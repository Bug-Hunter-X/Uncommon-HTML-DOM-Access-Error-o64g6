# Uncommon HTML DOM Access Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to accessing DOM elements before they are fully loaded into the browser. Attempting to manipulate a DOM element that hasn't been parsed yet results in a `null` reference. This is different from common syntax errors, which are easier to detect.

The `bug.html` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version.

## The Problem
The issue arises when JavaScript code tries to interact with a DOM element before the browser has finished rendering it.  This usually happens when the script runs *before* the element appears in the HTML structure.

## The Solution
The solution is to ensure the script that accesses the DOM element runs *after* the element is loaded.  This is frequently achieved using the `DOMContentLoaded` event or a `setTimeout` function to give the browser time to render the element.
